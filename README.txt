Tri-Axis Gyro Breakout - L3G4200D
 
This is a breakout board for the L3G4200D low-power three-axis angular rate sensor. The L3G4200D has a full scale of ±250/±500/±2000 dps and is capable of measuring rates with a user-selectable bandwidth. These work great in gaming and virtual reality input devices, GPS navigation systems and robotics.

Features:

Three selectable full scales (250/500/2000 dps)
I2C/SPI digital output interface
16 bit-rate value data output
8-bit temperature data output
Wide supply voltage: 2.4 V to 3.6 V
Low voltage-compatible IOs (1.8 V)
Embedded power-down and sleep mode
Embedded temperature sensor
High shock survivability
